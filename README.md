# Playlist backup

Core problem: we spend YEARS cultivating the perfect spotify playlist, but we could delete with no undo! This gives a way to create low-tech backup of our list.

Todo:

_Required:_

- [] Download button downloads a JSON backup
- [] Custom URL for playlist backup

_Bonus:_

- [] Create _users_ and track logins
- [] Save related backups in the cloud
- [] Install analytics, error tracking, prod stack

## Things I've had to do:

"postinstall": "remix setup node"
